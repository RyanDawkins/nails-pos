# Contributing
Nails Pos will accept contributions that are features scheduled to be completed, bug fixes or that are in the github issues.

We follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
for development. We recommend you read this article to familiarize yourself.

## Tests
If your code does not include tests we will **not** even consider your pull request. We try to follow the process of writing failing tests before writing code.
