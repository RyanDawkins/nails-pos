# Contributing
Nails Pos will accept contributions that are features scheduled to be completed, bug fixes or that are in the github issues.

We follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
for development. We recommend you read this article to familiarize yourself.

## Tests
If your code does not include tests we will **not** even consider your pull request. We try to follow the process of writing failing tests before writing code.

## Trello
Our project planning can be found on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/g1uyuywQ/nails-pos).

We plan on working in 2 week sprints with modest goals. At the end of each spring, we will review the sprint so we can continue to set realistic goals and continually monitor the progress of the project.
